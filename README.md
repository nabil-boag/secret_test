Secret Test
===========

This script tests a "secret()" function with all the prime numbers below a specified limit.

This script does the following:
* Takes the first argument from the command line as the limit
* Gets all the prime numbers up to the specified limit
* Checks if the "secret()" function is additive using the primes and prints a message


How to Run
==========

In your environment, change into the root directory of the project.

```bash
php secret_test.php 10
```

This should result in:

```bash
The secret function is additive with prime numbers under 10.
```
